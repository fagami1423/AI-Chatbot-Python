# AI-Chatbot-Python
The project aims to reduce the workforce and answer user queries more quickly. Chatbots have grown in popularity across businesses and are often regarded as one of the most practical implementations of natural language processing. Chatbot communication could be text-based, spoken, or non-flask. Chatbots can be used on PCs and smartphones, but they are most used on the internet. Many websites, including banks, educational institutions, and businesses, have built chatbots to respond to customer requests quickly. Chatbots are artificial devices that are designed to be user-friendly.
